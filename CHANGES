			SQUASHFS CHANGE LOG

1.0 	23 OCT 2002	Initial release

1.0c 	14 NOV 2002	Bug fix release

	Fixed bugs with initrds and device nodes

1.1	8 JAN 2002	Added features

	1. Kernel squashfs can now mount different byte order filesystems.
	2. Additional features added to mksquashfs.  Mksquashfs now supports
	   exclude files and multiple source files/directories can be
	   specified.  A nopad option has also been added, which
	   informs mksquashfs not to pad filesystems to a multiple of 4K.
	   See README for mksquashfs usage changes.
	3. Greater than 2GB filesystems bug fix.  Filesystems greater than 2GB
	   can now be created.
	4. Patch for 2.4.20 kernels.

1.1b	16 JAN 2002	Bug fix release

	Fixed readpage deadlock bug.  This was a rare deadlock bug that happened when
	pushing pages into the page cache when using greater than 4K blocks.  I never
	got this bug when I tested the filesystem, but two people emailed me on the same
	day about the problem!  I fixed it by using a page cache function that wasn't
	there when I originally did the work, which was nice :-)
