			INSTALLING SQUASHFS

The squashfs1.3.tar.gz file contains this file, a README file,
an ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS file, a CHANGES file, the squashfs patch directories/files, and
the squashfs-tools directory (mksquashfs).

1. Patching the kernel
----------------------

There are four kernel patch directories depending on your linux kernel version.
In each directory there are patches to provide squashfs1.3 support from a base kernel,
and incremental upgrade patches, that will upgrade a squashfs1.2 patched kernel
to a squashfs1.3 kernel (except for 2.6.0-test1).

To patch your kernel, cd into the top level directory, and run the "patch"
comand, e.g. assuming linux-2.4.20

%cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.20
%patch -p1 < location-of-squashfs/linux-2.4.20/squashfs1.3-patch

Where "location-of-squashfs" is the path to the squashfs1.3 source directory.

The squashfs patches patch the relevant kernel files to add configure support,
initrd support, include files, and the squashfs directory under linux/fs/.
Once patched, the kernel must be reconfigured, with squashfs support turned on
(either Y/M) to ensure that inflatefs is built into the kernel.  The
squashfs kernel option can be found in the filesystems subsection of the
configure menus.

2. Building squashfs tools
--------------------------

The squashfs-tools directory contains the mksquashfs program.  This can be
made by typing make.  The Makefile assumes that the squashfs patched
kernel is in /usr/src/linux.  The program uses Large File Support
(64 bit offsets etc.) and so a relatively recent glibc is needed.
