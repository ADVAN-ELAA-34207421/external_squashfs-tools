			INSTALLING SQUASHFS

The squashfs1.1.tar.gz file contains this file, a readme file, a changes file,
the squashfs patch files, and the squashfs-tools directory (mksquashfs).

There are three kernel patch files depending on your 2.4.x kernel version.
squashfs1.1-2.4.19-patch will patch 2.4.19 kernels.  squashfs1.1-2.4.20-patch
will patch 2.4.20 kernels, and squashfs1.0d-1.1-patch will upgrade a
squashfs1.0d patched 2.4.19 kernel to a new squashfs1.1 patched 2.4.19 kernel.

The squashfs patches patch the relevant kernel files to add configure support,
initrd support, include files, and the squashfs directory under linux/fs/.
Once patched, the kernel must be reconfigured, with squashfs support turned on
(either Y/M) to ensure that inflatefs is built into the kernel.

The squashfs-tools directory contains the mksquashfs program.  This can be
made by typing make.  The Makefile assumes that the squashfs patched
kernel is in /usr/src/linux.  The program uses Large File Support
(64 bit offsets etc.) and so a relatively recent glibc is needed.
