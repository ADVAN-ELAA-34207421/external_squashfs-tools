			ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to everyone who have download squashfs.  I appreciate people
using it, and any feedback you have.

The following have provided useful feedback, which has guided
some of the extra features in squashfs.

Mark Robson - pointed out early on that initrds didn't work

Adam Warner - pointed out that greater than 2GB filesystems didn't work.

John Sutton - raised the problem when archiving the entire filesystem
(/) there was no way to prevent /proc being archived.  This prompted
exclude files.

Martin Mueller (LinuxTV) - noticed that the filesystem length in the
superblock doesn't match the output filesystem length.  This is due to
padding to a 4K boundary.  This prompted the addition of the -nopad option.
He also reported a problem where 32K block filesystems hung when used as initrds.

Arkadiusz Patyk reported a problem where 32K block filesystems hung when used
as a root filesystem mounted as a loopback device.

Joe Blow emailed me that I'd forgotten to put anything in the README about
mounting the squashfs filesystem.
