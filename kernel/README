Squashfs is now in mainline at www.kernel.org.
These files are a CVS sync of my git development tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pkl/squashfs-devel.git.  I still
intend to keep these files in sync because they contain the development
history prior to mainlining.

Unfortunately, these files are currently out of sync with the kernel.org
git tree.

Squashfs is targetted at mainline.  These files, however, should
compile on 2.6.28, but not on anything older.

The patch files in this directory are completely out of date, and won't work
anymore.
