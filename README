CVS status:

New 4.0 disk layout.

Squashfs-tools: mksquashfs generates 4.0 layout.  Unsquashfs building
disabled because it is currently broken due to code changes elsewhere.

kernel: this directory now tracks the git tree at kernel.org, following
mainlining of Squashfs.  Please read the README in kernel/ for further
information.

kernel-2.4: prehistoric.  Not updated since the 3.1 release.  If you still need
Squashfs support in the 2.4 kernel then use the squashfs 3.1 release.  This
is the last release that supported 2.4 kernels.
