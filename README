CVS status:

CVS reflects squashfs3.1-r2, plus

	1.  Support for NFS exportable filesystems
	2.  Additional checks for corrupt filesystems generated by
	    fsfuzz.

No support for 2.4.x kernels.  NFS exporting in 2.4.x was substantially
different, and it is unclear whether anyone wants NFS support for linux
2.4.x.
