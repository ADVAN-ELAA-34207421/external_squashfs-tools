CVS status:

CVS reflects the official release of 3.0 with the following alterations.
CVS has a couple of updates to Unsquashfs, and a new parallelised
version of Mksquashfs (in squashfs-tools/par_mksquashfs).

Description:

Squashfs 3.0 is a major improvement to Squashfs.  Squashfs 3.0 offers the
following improvements to Squashfs 2.x.

	1. Filesystems are no longer limited to 4 GB.  In
	   theory 2^64 or 4 exabytes is now supported.

	2. Files are no longer limited to 4 GB.  In theory the maximum
	   file size is 4 exabytes.

	3. Metadata (inode table and directory tables) are no longer
	   restricted to 16 Mbytes.

	4. Hardlinks are now suppported.

	5. Nlink counts are now supported.

	6. Readdir now returns '.' and '..' entries.

	7. Inode numbers are now stored within the inode rather than being
	   computed from inode location on disk (this is not so much an
	   improvement, but a change forced by the previously listed
	   improvements).


There is kernel code for both linux 2.6.x (in the kernel directory)
and linux 2.4.x (in the kernel-2.4 directory), and it should work on all
recent versions of the kernels.  The kernel files should be applied to
an existing Squashfs 3.0 patched kernel, the files replace the
Squashfs files, keeping the necessary Squashfs patches in the other
kernel files.
