This is the initial import of Squashfs 3.0.  This is a prerelease
of 3.0, and so backwards compatibility with older versions (1.x, 2.x)
is not supported, and mksquashfs will not append to filesystems.

The kernel code is for linux 2.6.x and should work on all recent
versions of the 2.6 kernel.  The kernel files should be applied to
an existing Squashfs 2.2-r2 patched kernel, the files replace the
Squashfs files, keeping the necessary Squashfs patches in the other
kernel files.

Squashfs 3.0 is a major improvement to Squashfs.  The following
improvements have been made.

	1. Filesystems are no longer limited to 4 GB.  In
	   theory 2^64 or 4 exabytes is now supported.

	2. Files are no longer limited to 4 GB.  In theory the maximum
	   file size is 4 exabytes.

	3. Metadata (inode table and directory tables) are no longer
	   restricted to 16 Mbytes.

	4. Hardlinks are now suppported.

	5. Nlink counts are now supported.

	6. Readdir now returns '.' and '..' entries.

	7. Inode numbers are now stored within the inode rather than being
	   computed from inode location on disk (this is not so much an
	   improvement, but a change forced by the previously listed
	   improvements).
